## How to set-up in vs code
1) Download the zip file and open the file in the visual code or any other preferred editor.
2) Keep in mind that you must have the xammp downloaded and set-up to run the php code.
3) You must unzip the `css`, `images` and `js` folder and copy the folder with the same name, where you copy all the code to run the website successfully.
4) Open the `Login.php` file in the web browser.
5) Add the sql database name ("shop_db") in the mysql page of the admin of the xampp folder and copy the file in the htdocs folder of the xampp folder of the windows c drive folder. 
6) To add your own products, you need to log in to the admin page. Once there, navigate to the products section and input the product name, product price, and upload the product image in JPEG format. After completing these steps, the product will be available in the user section. ![Screenshot (27)](https://github.com/Priangshu-18/GreenBasket/assets/157562695/7f040ddf-b8c7-46f8-bea5-e90470a3393a)
